## XCConfigs
Allows to set any building params before compile. It could be usefull to have alpha, beta and release instances of the app installed on device in the same time.

## Linter
Allows to keep code base in one code style, help to improve code review proccess

## Code  generator
The tools like XCode templates or Generamba allows to reduce time for creating boiler plate code for new module. 

## UITests
UI tests are essential to a project as they automate the verification of the app's user interface, ensuring correct functionality, validating user interactions, supporting continuous integration, and providing confidence in the reliability of the app across various devices and scenarios.

## Routing 
Invest some time and decide which routing pattern we can use for encapsulatig router logic. It allow us to test routing logic and keep the logic independent on other parts of logic

## Multi modules
We need to understand how many teams our ios deparment will have, in case we have more then 3 engineers or more than 1 team it would be important to support multi modules architecture. It will allow to bring tasks in parralel.
