Hi again guys! Few words about the technical task.
The structure of the project: for every feature i created separated folder. It allows us to move features into separated modules in case when our team will be grown

For every feature we can  choose any architecture, in my case i choose MVVM, because it is a  bit more  convinient using SwiftUI because of bindings
Also for every feature there is no big difference  UIKit or SwiftUI will be  used.  In my case  i choose SwiftUI for building UI  and  UIKit for navigation because SwiftUI allows us to build  UI really fast but navigation works much more better with UIKit.

Also i created Technical improvment document where i added some suggestions, feel  free to check it.

And i am so sorry about double spaces and doble letters, i spilled coffee on the keyboard and i have to use another one with  verry bad quality :)

Have a great day guys.
